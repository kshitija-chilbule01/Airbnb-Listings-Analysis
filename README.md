## üìåProject Overview
This project aims to analyze Airbnb listings in Paris to understand the impact of recent regulatory changes on the short-term rental market. The analysis leverages data from over 250,000 listings across 10 major global cities, including Paris, as well as approximately 5 million guest reviews.

Through this exploratory analysis, we investigate how these new regulations are influencing Airbnb activity in terms of listing availability, pricing strategies, guest experiences, and host behavior.

## üìÇDatasets Used
The project is based on two main datasets:

```listings.csv``` ‚Äì Contains detailed information about Airbnb listings.

```reviews.csv``` ‚Äì Includes guest review data for each listing.
