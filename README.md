# Data Cleaning and Analysis: Stack Overflow Annual Developer Survey Dataset
## Table of Contents

## Overview
- The main aim of this project is to clean the Stack Overflow Developer Survey dataset and transform it to a form suitable for further exploratory data analysis for better interpretation or predictive modeling
- Data Cleaning is an essential crucial step in any Data Science and Analytics project which is usually carried out right after getting the dataset from an appropriate source
- To be able to derive meaningful insights from the data and to build reliable predictive models, we must inspect the data thoroughly and identify and handle any errors or inconsistencies present
- The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my skills in working on and cleaning large real-world datasets

## Data Collection
- The data comprises the results of the survey conducted by Stack Overflow in the year 2024
  - [Data Source](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/)
- The data is compiled in two csv files:
  - ```survey_results_public.csv```: The survey results dataset
  - ```survey_results_schema.csv```: description about the columns
- The dataset consists of over 65,437 observations and 114 features
- The dataset contains several nested columns, missing values, inaccurate, and inconsistent values that require thorough inspection for identification
- This dataset was particularly chosen for this project due to its complexity and to demonstrate my proficiency in cleaning real-world datasets
